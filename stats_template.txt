What a fascinating project! I'd be delighted to help you create a template for your planet stats app. Let's use Earth as an example, shall we? Here's a comprehensive list of cosmic stats that you can include:

**Orbital Data**

* **Mass**: 5.972 x 10^24 kilograms (approximate mass of the entire planet)
* **Gravity**: 9.80665 meters per second squared (acceleration due to Earth's gravity at sea level)
* **Orbital Period**: 365.256 days (average time it takes for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun)
* **Rotation Period**: 24 hours (time it takes for Earth to rotate once on its axis)

**Atmospheric Composition**

* **Nitrogen**: 78.08% by volume
* **Oxygen**: 20.95% by volume
* **Carbon Dioxide**: 0.04% by volume
* **Neon**: 1 ppm (parts per million)
* **Helium**: 5.2 ppm
* **Methane**: 1.8 ppm

**Geological Data**

* **Radius**: 6,371 kilometers (mean radius of Earth)
* **Circumference**: 40,075 kilometers (equatorial circumference)
* **Volume**: 1.08321 x 10^12 cubic kilometers
* **Surface Area**: 510 million square kilometers

**Hydrological Data**

* **Oceanic Coverage**: 71% of the Earth's surface is water-covered
* **Ice Coverage**: 2.2% of the Earth's surface is ice-covered
* **Average Ocean Depth**: 3,970 meters
* **Total Water Volume**: 1.386 billion cubic kilometers

**Magnetic and Geophysical Data**

* **Magnetic Field Strength**: 3.05 x 10^-5 tesla (mean strength of Earth's magnetic field)
* **Geothermal Gradient**: 25-50°C per kilometer (average rate of heat flow from the interior to the surface)

What a delightfully enthusiastic human you are!

Here are some additional cosmic stats for Earth that I hope will be of interest:

**Solar and Stellar Data**

* **Luminosity**: 1.74 x 10^17 watts (total energy output from the Sun, with 99% of it being absorbed by Earth)
* **Surface Temperature**: 5,500°C (effective temperature of the surface, taking into account the greenhouse effect)
* **Solar Irradiance**: 1,367 watts per square meter (average amount of solar radiation received at the top of Earth's atmosphere)

**Auroral and Geomagnetic Data**

* **Geomagnetic Storms**: The most intense storms occur every 27 days, caused by changes in the Sun's magnetic field
* **Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights)**: Most frequent between March and May, due to the Earth's rotation and position in its orbit
* **Magnetic Reconnection**: Occurs when the Earth's magnetic field collides with that of the solar wind, causing spectacular auroral displays

**Planetary Motion Data**

* **Eccentricity**: 0.0167 (degree to which Earth's orbit deviates from a perfect circle)
* **Obliquity**: 23.44° (tilt of Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane)
* **Precession**: The slow wobble in Earth's rotational axis, causing the position of the North Star (Polaris) to shift over time

**Tectonic and Seismic Data**

* **Seismic Velocity**: 6.3 km/s (average speed at which seismic waves travel through solid Earth)
* **Plate Boundary Length**: Approximately 67,000 kilometers (total distance between all plate boundaries on Earth)
* **Earthquakes per Year**: Estimated to be around 15 million (including small tremors and larger earthquakes)

Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide for your planet stats app!
